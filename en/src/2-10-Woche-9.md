## Week 9 and 10 - Deepen content and enrich with value

 These two weeks are about the core of curating, it's about arranging, editing, rearranging, evaluating, contextualizing and adding value to content. Everything that has happened up to this point has been the \"pre-work\" so to speak. Now it's a matter of analyzing content once again in detail, filtering out superfluous and outdated information, arranging content and providing it with a benefit (sensemaking). This is the heart of content curation and cannot be done by algorithms. Algorithms can only filter.

 Think about how much work you want to put in and how you can create value for your target audience. Note that there are different deep levels of sensemaking (adding value), 3 of which we would like to briefly introduce here:

- **Reasoned recommendations from content and experts**

  Give your audience or tribe a reason or tip why they should spend valuable time and energy on your recommended content. 

   

  Example: ![Stefan Diepolder \@sdiepolder Feb 15 My #learning tip for the weekend: free mini course #FiIming with the #Smartphone without cutting - via \@Reporterfabrik - akademie.reporterfabrik.de/courses/course\... 16 0 45](./images/image20.png)

  This type of curation is perfectly adequate if your target audience can be found on social media and you have thoroughly studied a good article or video, for example, that you are eager to recommend.

   

- **Creation of your own content with curated content**\
   This next level goes deeper, both in terms of content and effort. Here you can write a blog post, an article, put together a presentation, draw a sketchnote, mind map or record a video. Be creative!

  Whenever you want to dive deeper into your topic, create some kind of landing page, or discuss your topic in depth, the above formats are great for adding value to your content. And of course [ePortfolios](https://cogneon.github.io/lernos-eportfolio/de/) of any kind (see also the neighboring Circle guide to "ePortfolio Learning").

  Here again are a few good examples:

- Content Curation Podcast by Stefan with colleagues Christoph Haffner and Thomas Jenewein from SAP Educast - <https://open.sap.com/static/education-newscast/?name=2020-02-07_educationnewscast073.mp3 - The interaction of audio and show notes is also important.

- A helpful sketchnote on \"Leading and Learning\" by Tanmay Vora. <http://qaspire.com/2015/01/23/3-cs-for-learning-and-leading-on-social-media/

- A particularly "valuable" blog post, both visually and in terms of content, by Maria Popova on Critical Thinking based on the classic \"Baloney detection Kit\" by Carl Sagan [https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/03/baloney-detection-kit-carl-sagan/\](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/03/baloney-detection-kit-carl-sagan/)

- **Creation and maintenance of a portal, a hub for your topic**\
 You curate and publish regularly on your specific topic, in which you are a proven expert. You make your findings public and compile them into an attractive, relevant portal. An example of this is the [\"Content Curation - Official Guide\"](https://medium.com/content-curation-official-guide) by Robin Good, created on the blog portal Medium.

**Week 9**

**Kata 15:**
Think about how much time you can and want to spend curating your topic. Do you want to recommend and promote other people's content or do you want to create your own content and present your own point of view? Does it make sense to set up your own blog or ePortfolio or do you write your articles in a portal such as Linkedin or Medium? What are the pros and cons of each?

Discuss in your lernOS group which type of curation suits your topics.

  

**Kata 16:**
By now you have collected many good sources for your topic and have read and filed them. Now it's time to dig a little deeper into the content and create something new of your own.

Take the content you've identified as the basis for your curation and analyze it very carefully. If you are using a video, for example, pause it every time you hear an interesting statement and take notes. If the video is visualized in an interesting way, take screenshots and label them with your own associations. Work through the content consistently.

- Have you gained any new insights? What is the core message of the content? Did any questions arise that you would answer? Write down questions and answers and start creating your content -- writing the blog post, drawing your sketchnote\... whatever medium you want to create.

- Present your base medium in the lernOS Circle and justify your own point of view. Are there any questions left open? Can you already answer these questions or does it make sense to look for further content? Take the suggestions of your colleagues and use them for your curation.
