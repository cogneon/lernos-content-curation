## Week 0 - Getting to know

**Welcome to the Content Curation Circle Guide!**

I'm glad you've come together and want to use this guide to learn how to learn effectively using contacts and resources from the Internet, and how to summarize and enrich what you've learned in a way that's helpful to you and others. Take time at the beginning to introduce yourselves to each other.

Ask yourself the following questions (or similar ones):

- Who are you?

- What do you do in your daily work?

- What are you particularly interested in?

- What topic have you always wanted to delve deeper into?

It has proven useful to also share private things about yourself - this promotes closeness to each other, strengthens trust and quickly reveals content-related points of
points of contact.
Take about 20 minutes for this.

**What is content curation and what can you expect over the next 13 weeks?**
To get an initial overview, look together at the basics of curation, especially what curation is and why you should curate. The content outline (see sketchnote) gives further clues as to what you can learn and work on in this Circle. Clarify any questions together.
Take about 15 minutes for this.

**Organization of the Circle**

Last but not least: How do you want to organize your Circle? We recommend that you organize Circles with a size of 4-6 people and arrange a fixed date each week when you will meet.

It has also been proven that an administrator sets up the technical environment (e.g. Microsoft Teams and OneNote), sets up the Circle Guide and a structure, e.g. with learning diaries, and invites the Circle members and sets up appointments.
Take about 20 minutes to do this.

**What basically happens in the Circle meetings?**

You will have 60 minutes to talk about what you have been working on during the week and how you have been doing. Before you
Before you start, arrive calmly and report in the check-in (approx. 10 minutes) how you have been working on the katas during the week. Share your learnings, your difficulties and "victories", ask your Circle colleagues for feedback and help. Make sure that everyone has their say. In some katas you will get additional information about what you can or should do.

Try to keep to the 60 minutes and it is a good idea to choose a moderator in each meeting who will lead the Circle and take care of the timekeeping.

The last 5 minutes of each Circle meeting you will have time for checkout (goodbyes, goals for the next meeting, private... etc.)

**Preparation Kata for the complete Circle**:

Think about what topics you would like to learn more about, watch some videos or blogposts - or listen to podcasts - and write down what you find particularly exciting about each topic. Work in the OneNote notebook you created or in another medium of your choice - ideally use media that your Circle members also have access to and can support and collaborate with.
