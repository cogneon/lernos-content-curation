**Content Curation lernOS Circle Guide**

***A guide to how you can find, make sense of, and share relevant content***.

Have no idea what content curation (or also called "digital content curation") is and would like to get an idea?

Content curation helps you put together valuable information about topics with the help of content and experts, without having to reinvent the wheel. You'll learn methods, forms, and approaches for thinking outside the box about your topic and sharing your emerging knowledge with others.

When you learn about content curation through this lernOS Circle Guide
you will learn about the mechanisms and differences between machine

**How to define curate?**

 Origin of the word "curate"
[in Langenscheidt Lexicon], https://de.langenscheidt.com/latein-deutsch/curare, accessed on
16.06.2020)

Latin "curare" means, among other things.

\...to take care of....

\...to care\...

\...to take the trouble\...

\...to have desire\....

There is no universal definition of content curation, but for us this short
but for us this short summary, based on Robin Good, defines very well what it is
what it is all about:

 

> **"Content curation is the art of finding, filtering, organizing, and delivering value to digital
> artifacts on a particular topic for a specific audience interest, filtering, organizing, adding value
> added and made publicly accessible. "**

Curation is not just the idea of a few internet-savvy geeks.

**Why curate?**

Our problem today is not the lack of information as it used to be,
but the lack of reliable and efficient filters. Professor
Clay Shirky puts it very clearly.

***"It\`s not information overload. It\`s filter failure."***

He explains the [Information Overload](https://youtu.be/XE38jpFOiv8) in 3
minutes on Youtube.

The world we live in today is characterized by abundance. To
to cope with abundance, effective filters are necessary. No matter
everywhere we look, the first decisions are taken from us, whether we like it or not.
taken away from us, whether we like it or not. Our Google home page, the
access to the world's largest library, knows and remembers our
preferences and our search history -- and suggests to us, optimized and filtered by algorithms
algorithms to suggest what should interest us most in our search.
should be of most interest to us in our search.

If you want to go a little deeper - the [Video "Beware of the Online
Filter Bubbles"](https://youtu.be/B8ofWFx525s) by Eli Pariser
describes how this mechanism works (09:05 minutes)

We go to a supermarket -- and find the products at
eye level that the supermarket owner thinks we should buy --
and not the products we actually want, such as
particularly low-priced or sustainable, regionally produced
products. And, and, and.... Let's be aware - we live in a
world that is characterized by abundance and filtered and curated for us.
curated for us - and in which many decisions and opportunities are already anticipated by
technical systems or people are anticipated.

Music is a good example here, especially also for the
diversity and abundance in today's world: As recently as the 17th century, music was something very special.
Century, music was something very special. It could only be enjoyed live
and only a very few rich and famous people had access to it.

music was made replayable, from the first gramophones, record
gramophones, record players, cassette and CD players to the invention of the mp3
invention of the mp3 format and thus the digitization of music.
In the meantime, everyone can have their personal music with them on their smartphone anytime
and everywhere, often aggregated by powerful portals like
YouTube, Spotify or iTunes. We can find all kinds of music styles from
from every corner of the world, and very quickly we are overwhelmed by the abundance of
overwhelmed with the abundance of possibilities. To counter this, the music portals use recommendations
recommendations calculated by algorithms, enable the exchange of information
and recommendations among friends, for example, also provide their own,
filtered offers and playlists.

 

And when it comes to knowledge, information and content, it's even more
more extreme, because knowledge grows exponentially. As the figure below
shows, knowledge doubled every 13 months in 2017, with the trend
in the direction of "much faster." Contributing to this, for example, are
simple systems and devices that are easy and quick for everyone to
and can be shared many times over in a flash via portals and social media.

We are therefore heavily dependent on curation and, especially in the
digital world, it constantly surrounds and influences us, often without our

**What characterizes a curator?**

Curators create and design a space, arrange the artifacts they have selected and filtered artifacts and give them a new, individual value. a new, individual value. Like, for example, a curator in an art exhibition. art exhibition. A content curator learns by himself/herself incredibly quickly and efficiently by intensively dealing with topics topics, immersing himself/herself, filtering and organizing, curating

Especially the process of enrichment or sensemaking, in which one deals intensively with the collected contents, validates them validating it, questioning it, and creating something new from it, such as a blog post, a podcast, or a video from it, initiates an efficient and intensive and intensive learning process and helps to make good and well-founded decisions. to be able to make.

 

Good curators know their audience and their needs and interests. They are very well connected, both with their target group (the so-called "tribe") and with knowledge carriers and thought leaders relevant to their topic.
thought leaders who are relevant to \"their" topic. They think and work like investigative journalists, who work diligently and meticulously to find, filter and collect the best content nuggets.

**How does curation work?**

Content curation, as it is used in many fields today, has emerged from the overabundance of information, some of which is difficult to assess and relate. It reflects the need to find relevant information, to filter it, to record it, to check it for facts and truthfulness, and then to enrich it and create points of connection to existing knowledge.

 

One possible approach to these steps is a three-step process according to Harold Jarche (2014) (<https://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/>), which can be

1. deals with **searching or finding** content, information and

2. dem **Filtern und Organisieren** und im weiteren, wichtigen Schritt

3. und schließlich den Möglichkeiten des **Teilens und Austauschens**.

3. **Teilen & Austauschen**\
