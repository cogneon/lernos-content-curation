<p>lernOS is a method of self-organization for people living and working
in the 21st century. To be successful today, you need to constantly
learn, organize and develop. No one else is responsible for this
process. You have to take care of it yourself (self-directed, lifelong
learning).</p>

<p><strong>Content Curation lernOS Circle Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>A guide on how to find, make sense of, and share relevant
content</em></strong></p>
<p>You have no idea what content curation (or also called “digital
content curation”) is and would like to get a picture of it?</p>
<p>Content curation helps you put together valuable information about
topics with the help of content and experts, without having to reinvent
the wheel. You’ll learn methods, forms, and approaches for thinking
outside the box about your topic and sharing your emerging knowledge
with others.</p>
<p>When you learn about content curation through this lernOS Circle
Guide, you will learn about the mechanisms and differences between
machine filters (via algorithms) and human filters. But you’ll also
learn to use curation for yourself and your life: to work more openly
and visibly, and to learn to cope with the flood of available knowledge,
help others, save time, and understand things. Along the way, you’ll
gain reputation and expertise, within your organization or in your
network. You will learn that networks based on trust are the key to cope
with our complex world and to learn and innovate quickly and
effectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you want more details to help you decide if the Content Curation
guide is right for you, listen to Stefan`s podcast on Content Curation –
it will definitely help you gain some insights into the topic and decide
if you want to spend the next 13 weeks more intensively involved in
Content Curation.</p>

<p><strong>Basics</strong></p>
<p>If you are thinking about doing this Circle, it is best to take a
look at the following basics we have put together for you.</p>
<p> </p>

<li><p><strong>What is curation?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How can one define curating?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why curate?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>What characterizes curators?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How does curation work?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is curation?</strong> You can get a first insight via
the video Stefan recorded at a meetup of the Colearn Community Munich
#clc089: [“Content Curation” by Stefan Diepolder at the meetup of the

<p> </p>
<p><img src="./images/image2.png" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can one define curating?</strong></p>
<p>Origin of the word “curare” [in Wikipedia],
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/curare#:~:text=(transitive%2C%20medicine)%20to%20treat,patient%2C%20disease%2C%20etc.),
accessed on 28.07.2023)</p>
<p>Latin “curare” means, among other things.</p>
<p>...care...</p>
<p>...provide...</p>
<p>...take the trouble...</p>
<p>...Feel like it...</p>
<p>There is no universal definition of content curation, but for us this
short summary, adapted from Robin Good, defines very well what it is all
about:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Content curation is the art of finding, filtering,
organizing, and adding value to digital information building blocks and
artifacts on a specific topic for a specific audience interest and
making them publicly available.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robin Good: <a
href="https://medium.com/content-curation-official-guide/what-is-content-curation-84212256e84">What
is Content Curation?</a> (accessed on 16.06.2020)</p>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curation is not just the idea of a few Internet-savvy freaks. Even if
they are often not called that, the skills of curators belong to the
core competencies of the 21st century, as the <a
href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/web-literacy/">Mozilla
Foundation</a>, for example, has worked out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Curation skills such as share, compose, remix, evaluate, synthesize,
search, connect, contribute are among the 21st Century Skills promoted
by the Mozilla Foundation in Web Literacy. If you go to the pages, you
can go through curated learning paths on each skill. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why curate?</strong></p>
<p>Our problem today is no longer the lack of information, as it used to
be, but the lack of reliable and efficient filters. Professor Clay
Shirky expresses this very clearly.</p>
<p><strong><em>“It`s not information overload. It`s filter
failure.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Source: Clay Shirky. AZQuotes.com, [Wind and Fly LTD], 2020.
https://www.azquotes.com/quote/409865, accessed on 18.06.2020.  </p>
<p>He explains the <a href="https://youtu.be/XE38jpFOiv8">Information
Overload</a> in 3 minutes on Youtube.</p>
<p>The world we live in today is characterized by abundance. To cope
with abundance, effective filters are necessary. No matter where we
look, the first decisions are taken from us everywhere, whether we like
it or not. Our Google home page, the gateway to the world’s largest
library, knows and remembers our preferences and search history down to
the last detail – and suggests to us, optimized and filtered by
algorithms, what should interest us most in our search.</p>
<p>If you want to go a little deeper - the <a
href="https://youtu.be/B8ofWFx525s">video “Beware of the Online Filter
Bubbles”</a> by Eli Pariser describes how this mechanism works (09:05
minutes)</p>
<p>We go to a supermarket – and find the eye-level products that
supermarket owners think we should buy – and not the products we
actually want, such as particularly low-priced or sustainable, locally
produced products. And, and, and…. Let’s be aware - we live in a world
that is shaped by abundance and filtered and curated for us – and where
many choices and possibilities are already anticipated by technical
systems or people.</p>
<p>Music is a good example here, especially for the diversity and
abundance in our world today: In the 17th century, music was still
something very special. It could only be enjoyed live and only a very
few rich and famous people had access to it. Then, starting in the 19th
century, technical devices were invented to make music playable, from
the first gramophones, record players, cassette and CD players to the
invention of the mp3 format and thus the digitization of music. In the
meantime, everyone can have their personal music on their smartphone
with them wherever they go, often aggregated from powerful portals like
YouTube, Spotify or iTunes. We find all kinds of music styles from every
corner of the world and very quickly we are overwhelmed with the
abundance of possibilities. To counter this, the music portals use
recommendations calculated by algorithms, enable the exchange and
recommendations among friends, for example, also provide their own
filtered offers and playlists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And when it comes to knowledge, information and content, it’s even
more extreme, because knowledge grows exponentially. As the figure below
shows, knowledge doubled every 13 months in 2017, with a trend toward
“much faster”. Contributing to this, for example, are simple systems and
devices that are easy and quick for anyone to use by anyone and can be
shared via portals and social media at lightning speed and many times
over. Keeping a good overview, being able to separate the wheat from the
chaff, is more important than ever.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>So we rely heavily on curation, and especially in the digital world,
it surrounds and influences us constantly, often without us being
consciously aware of it. That’s why we think it’s important to look at
curation and its mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>What characterizes curators?</strong></p>
<p>Curators create and design a space, arrange the artifacts they have
selected and filtered, and thereby give them a new, individual value.
For example, a curator of an art exhibition. A content curator learns
incredibly quickly and efficiently by intensively exploring topics,
immersing himself with topics, immerses himself/herself, filters and
orders, curates him/herself. Especially the process of enrichment or
sensemaking, in which one deals intensively with the collected content,
validates it, questions it and creates something new, such as a blog
post, a podcast or a video from it, initiates an efficient and intensive
learning process and helps to be able to make good and well-founded
decisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good curators know their audience and their needs and interests. They
are very well connected, both with their target group (the so-called
“tribe”) and with knowledge carriers and thought leaders who are
relevant to “their” topic. They think and work much like investigative
journalists who work diligently and meticulously to find, filter, and
collect the best content nuggets. They take care of their audience by
providing them with their best sources and adding personal value to
them, giving their audience a reason to engage with the content or
topic.</p>

<p><strong>How does curation work?</strong></p>
<p>Content curation, as it is used in many areas today, has emerged from
the overabundance of information, some of which is difficult to assess
and relate. It reflects the need to find relevant information, filter
it, record it, check it for facts and truthfulness, and then enrich it
and create points of connection to existing knowledge.</p>
<p>One possible approach to these steps is a three-step process
according to Harold Jarche (2014) (<a
href="https://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/"
class="uri">https://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/</a>)
that addresses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>is concerned with <strong>searching for or finding</strong>
content, information, and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>experts deals,</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>the <strong>filtering and organizing</strong> and in the further,
important step</p>
<blockquote>
<p>then <strong>enriching</strong> this content with <strong>value and
opinions</strong>,</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>and finally the possibilities of <strong>sharing and
exchanging</strong>.</p></li>

<p> <em>Competence to assess the curators (values) - values should be
clear</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Search respectively find</strong><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s about finding interesting and relevant information and staying
up to date. Distinguishing the really helpful, readable and learnable
posts from the “chatter” among all the “noise”. And to build a network
of trusted sources and experts over time. So that people not only seek
out information, but it automatically finds its way to us through our
network. Good curators are also always reliable members of knowledge
networks.<br />
 </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Filter, organize and enrich</strong><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filtering means separating the wheat from the chaff, knowing which
sources and people you can trust and how to distinguish areas of
knowledge from one another so as not to lose the red thread. In the next
step, you have to find a clear and time-saving way to store the
information, sort it and make it quickly findable. Then, in the most
important step, enriching the value and benefit for the target group,
you can work with the content in a meaningful way and, for example,
write summaries, create cross-references, compare, ask critical
questions, and so on. Curating yourself and creating an article or
blogpost from different building blocks and artifacts is a very
effective and powerful way to learn and build knowledge yourself.<br />
 </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Share &amp; Exchange</strong><br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is about developing a sense and practice for yourself, how to
share your enriched content, when and with whom, how to share ideas and
experiences in your networks, get feedback, get inspiration or
collaborate with colleagues in your work.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.1" id="week-0---getting-to-know"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Week 0 - Getting to know</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Content Curation Circle Guide!</strong></p>
<p>I’m glad you’ve come together and want to use this guide to learn how
to learn effectively using contacts and resources from the Internet, and
how to summarize and enrich what you’ve learned in a way that’s helpful
to you and others. Take time at the beginning to introduce yourselves to
each other.</p>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions (or similar ones):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Who are you?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you do in your daily work?</p></li>
<li><p>What are you particularly interested in?</p></li>
<li><p>What topic have you always wanted to delve deeper into?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It has proven useful to also share private things about yourself -
this promotes closeness to each other, strengthens trust and quickly
reveals content-related points of points of contact. Take about 20
minutes for this.</p>
<p><strong>What is content curation and what can you expect over the
next 13 weeks?</strong> To get an initial overview, look together at the
basics of curation, especially what curation is and why you should
curate. The content outline (see sketchnote) gives further clues as to
what you can learn and work on in this Circle. Clarify any questions
together. Take about 15 minutes for this.</p>
<p><strong>Organization of the Circle</strong></p>
<p>Last but not least: How do you want to organize your Circle? We
recommend that you organize Circles with a size of 4-6 people and
arrange a fixed date each week when you will meet.</p>
<p>It has also been proven that an administrator sets up the technical
environment (e.g. Microsoft Teams and OneNote), sets up the Circle Guide
and a structure, e.g. with learning diaries, and invites the Circle
members and sets up appointments. Take about 20 minutes to do this.</p>
<p><strong>What basically happens in the Circle meetings?</strong></p>
<p>You will have 60 minutes to talk about what you have been working on
during the week and how you have been doing. Before you Before you
start, arrive calmly and report in the check-in (approx. 10 minutes) how
you have been working on the katas during the week. Share your
learnings, your difficulties and “victories”, ask your Circle colleagues
for feedback and help. Make sure that everyone has their say. In some
katas you will get additional information about what you can or should
do.</p>
<p>Try to keep to the 60 minutes and it is a good idea to choose a
moderator in each meeting who will lead the Circle and take care of the
timekeeping.</p>
<p>The last 5 minutes of each Circle meeting you will have time for
checkout (goodbyes, goals for the next meeting, private… etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Preparation Kata for the complete Circle</strong>:</p>
<p>Think about what topics you would like to learn more about, watch
some videos or blogposts - or listen to podcasts - and write down what
you find particularly exciting about each topic. Work in the OneNote
notebook you created or in another medium of your choice - ideally use
media that your Circle members also have access to and can support and
collaborate with.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2"
id="week-9-and-10---deepen-content-and-enrich-with-value"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Week 9 and 10 - Deepen content
and enrich with value</h2>
<p>These two weeks are about the core of curating, it’s about arranging,
editing, rearranging, evaluating, contextualizing and adding value to
content. Everything that has happened up to this point has been the
"pre-work" so to speak. Now it’s a matter of analyzing content once
again in detail, filtering out superfluous and outdated information,
arranging content and providing it with a benefit (sensemaking). This is
the heart of content curation and cannot be done by algorithms.
Algorithms can only filter.</p>
<p>Think about how much work you want to put in and how you can create
value for your target audience. Note that there are different deep
levels of sensemaking (adding value), 3 of which we would like to
briefly introduce here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reasoned recommendations from content and
experts</strong></p>
<p>Give your audience or tribe a reason or tip why they should spend
valuable time and energy on your recommended content. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Example: <img src="./images/image20.png"
alt="Stefan Diepolder @sdiepolder Feb 15 My #learning tip for the weekend: free mini course #FiIming with the #Smartphone without cutting - via @Reporterfabrik - akademie.reporterfabrik.de/courses/course... 16 0 45" /></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/sdiepolder/status/1096449666504445952 </p>
<p>This type of curation is perfectly adequate if your target audience
can be found on social media and you have thoroughly studied a good
article or video, for example, that you are eager to recommend.</p>
<p> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creation of your own content with curated
content</strong><br />
This next level goes deeper, both in terms of content and effort. Here
you can write a blog post, an article, put together a presentation, draw
a sketchnote, mind map or record a video. Be creative!</p>
<p>Whenever you want to dive deeper into your topic, create some kind of
landing page, or discuss your topic in depth, the above formats are
great for adding value to your content. And of course <a
href="https://cogneon.github.io/lernos-eportfolio/de/">ePortfolios</a>
of any kind (see also the neighboring Circle guide to “ePortfolio
Learning”).</p>
<p>Here again are a few good examples:</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Creation and maintenance of a portal, a hub for your
topic</strong><br />
You curate and publish regularly on your specific topic, in which you
are a proven expert. You make your findings public and compile them into
an attractive, relevant portal. An example of this is the <a
href="https://medium.com/content-curation-official-guide">"Content
Curation - Official Guide"</a> by Robin Good, created on the blog portal
Medium.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Week 9</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kata 15:</strong> Think about how much time you can and want
to spend curating your topic. Do you want to recommend and promote other
people’s content or do you want to create your own content and present
your own point of view? Does it make sense to set up your own blog or
ePortfolio or do you write your articles in a portal such as Linkedin or
Medium? What are the pros and cons of each?</p>
<p>Discuss in your lernOS group which type of curation suits your
topics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kata 16:</strong> By now you have collected many good sources
for your topic and have read and filed them. Now it’s time to dig a
little deeper into the content and create something new of your own.</p>
<p>Take the content you’ve identified as the basis for your curation and
analyze it very carefully. If you are using a video, for example, pause
it every time you hear an interesting statement and take notes. If the
video is visualized in an interesting way, take screenshots and label
them with your own associations. Work through the content
consistently.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have you gained any new insights? What is the core message of the
content? Did any questions arise that you would answer? Write down
questions and answers and start creating your content – writing the blog
post, drawing your sketchnote... whatever medium you want to
create.</p></li>
<li><p>Present your base medium in the lernOS Circle and justify your
own point of view. Are there any questions left open? Can you already
answer these questions or does it make sense to look for further
content? Take the suggestions of your colleagues and use them for your
curation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="woche-10"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Woche 10</h2>
<p><strong>Kata 17:</strong></p>
<p>Find supplemental content to the source you analyzed in Task 2.
Ideally, you will find explanations that confirm or contradict the
information provided or answer the questions raised in the presentation
of your basic content. Dive deeper into your topic by finding and
analyzing new content. Has your judgment changed? Have your assessments
been confirmed? Keep working on your content. Share your insights!</p>
<p>Provide your Circle members or your community with the arranged
content elements or modules for review and ask them for feedback. This
can be done using a small test guide to help the reviewers. It’s best if
everyone looks at one module or the review is split evenly so it’s not
too much for one reviewer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kata 18:</strong></p>
<p>Almost there. Get to work incorporating feedback from your lernOS
colleagues into your curated content and finalizing it. It doesn’t have
to be perfect. It won’t be finished here either. It is the beginning of
a learning journey.</p>
<p>Are there people you want to show your curated content to in advance
and exclusively? People you trust to give you honest feedback? Send them
an access to your content and be happy.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4"
id="week-11---content-sharing-and-discussion."><span
class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Week 11 - Content sharing and
discussion.</h2>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about networks, the value of Trusted Guides, and
social media in curating over the past few weeks. Now it’s time to give
back to your community. Don’t wait until your blog, video, or podcast is
perfect and meets all your standards. They probably never will. And
there will always be people who don’t like your content. And there will
be those who will chafe at your content, insights and opinions. Those
are likely to be the most valuable, the ones who inspire you to
question, test, and evolve your executions in collaboration.</p>
<p>Start actively sharing your content, insights and recommendations.
You can do this either internally in your organization via the intranet
or internal social networks (e.g. Microsoft Yammer or HCL Connections)
or externally on the internet via social media, your blog or
networks.</p>
<p>Ideally, you will also succeed in sharing your ideas in talks,
barcamps, meetups, podcasts and presentations. This will not only help
you expand your network, but also sharpen your sensemaking skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some platforms we recommend out of very many where you can share your
content:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Intern:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Microsoft 365, e.g. Onenote and Teams, to share your content with
your team</p></li>
<li><p>Enterprise Social Networks e.g. Microsoft Yammer or HCL
Connections</p>
<p> </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extern:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.xing.com/home">Xing</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/">Pinterest</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://refind.com/">Refind</a> (Great also as
bookmarking app)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kata 19:</strong></p>
<p>Recommend a YouTube video, podcast or blog post that you find
particularly valuable on Twitter. Try to describe the added value in
short words and keyword it with #hashtags so that it can be easily found
even by interested people who don’t follow you. Monitor the reaction to
your post.</p>
<p>Discuss in The lernOS Group if and how your description could be
improved.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Kata 20:</strong></p>
<p>You’ve been working hard on your curated content for the past two
weeks. And you’ve already tested it in your lernOS group. Now it’s time
to get out there.</p>
<p>Use your favorite social network (internal and/or external) and
recommend your curated content. Ask well-connected colleagues for their
opinion – they’ll be sure to recommend it if they like your post.
Monitor and respond quickly and constructively to feedback. Ask for
ideas and comments.… Stay tuned to your topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Congratulations - you did it! You have actively curated and
gone public with “your” topic. And you have started your own personal
learning journey and let others share in it.</strong></p>
<p>How does it feel to learn out loud? Share your experiences and
feelings.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.5" id="week-12---putting-content-to-the-test"><span
class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Week 12 - Putting content to
the test</h2>
<p>Many of you will wonder why this point is mentioned here in the
guide. It is about content maintenance, which is especially important
for elaborately curated sources, e.g. creating permalinks so that links
remain visible on your site even if the structure of your source
changes. This is of course not done for aggregation and link
recommendations, but for example for annotated link collections, essays
etc.</p>
<p>To keep your collected sources and content and their assessment of
the topic up to date, you should look at them again and again and
critically examine whether they are still relevant and helpful enough or
whether there are new findings or sources in the meantime. Good curation
means living and developing your content. This can be done e.g. by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check and recheck content</p></li>
<li><p>Create permalinks and test links</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate new knowledge and adapt content</p></li>
<li><p>Create new knowledge links and make them visible</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p>Now the time has come. After 12 weeks, the last round of the Circle
is coming to an end and it’s time to look back on these weeks. At the
end, feel free to discuss what the biggest insights, surprises, or
challenges were for you in dealing with content curation and share with
the others.</p>
<p>The following questions can serve as a guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What do you take away as crucial experiences / highlights from
the last weeks?</p></li>
<li><p>What were the most important milestones / development steps for
you?</p></li>
<li><p>What did you miss or fall short of in the Circle or in the
creation of curated content?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your plans for content curation and what do you want to
achieve next?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What activities or requirements might there be in the
future to link your curated content together or even continue
together?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kata 21:</strong></p>
<p>Go through one of your enriched content/posts together at a time and
ask yourself the following questions and discuss them together:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Are the most important sources still relevant and in the right
order? <strong>(Ranking)</strong></li>
<li>Does the rationale still fit why they are particularly important?
(<strong>Persönliche Bewertung</strong>)</li>
<li>Are there recent supplemental graphics and learning videos
(<strong>learning</strong>) If needed, do a fact check again if you
think there may be outdated content with certain sources or “steered”
information may have emerged.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Kata 22 - Last exercise: PARTY</strong></p>
<p>Yay, hooray, you did it – studied together for 12 weeks, didn’t give
up, kept at it and learned so much about curating, not only
theoretically, but also practically. And you have built a relationship
of trust with each other during this time that is at least as valuable
as the work you have done together and from which you will benefit for a
long time to come. That’s why now is the time to celebrate. Get together
for a joint event (in person or online) and celebrate!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed the learning journey with our lernOS guide,
learned a lot with and from each other, and are now enthusiastic
curators. We, Stefan <a href="https://twitter.com/sdiepolder"><span

<p><strong>Thank you very much!</strong></p>
<h2 data-number="2.6" id="week-1---role-of-networks-communities"><span
class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Week 1 - Role of Networks &amp;
Communities</h2>
<p>We all live and work in communities and networks. With the Internet
and social media, they have become larger, more spatially distributed
and more international. The opportunities to forge relationships, access
and share knowledge have thus become much richer and more diverse. On
the other hand, our working world is becoming more specialized, complex
and interwoven. An individual can usually no longer know everything that
is necessary to solve a complex task and is dependent on a good network
that gives her/him quick access to relevant information. Good networking
skills have thus become one of the most important competencies for the
21st century - and also a fundamental requirement for any content
curator.</p>
<p>Networks and communities are of fundamental importance for curators:
they can be sources of relevant, valuable content and experts or the
starting point for researching and collecting such sources and finding
experts. In a further step, a content curator always acts as a “human
filter” who, guided by his or her own interests and knowledge
background, filters relevant and interesting information and content
from a large quantity.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of curators and well-curated sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Corporate Learning Community: &lt;https://colearn.de/ - Learning
network on corporate learning with contributions and activities by, for
and with the community.</li>
<li>Dr. Jochen Robes (<a
href="http://www.weiterbildungsblog.de">www.weiterbildungsblog.de</a>) -
developments on (digital) learning and continuing education.</li>
<li>Stefan Pfeiffer et al (https://cxokurator.com/) - curated
information on IT topics, such as cloud, artificial intelligence and IT
security - with a weekly livemeeting (9vor9)</li>
<li>Klaus Eck (&lt;https://pr-blogger.de/) - specialist for online
marketing and PR with many good channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kata 1:</strong> Create a collection of all networks and
communities around the topics you are interested in (private or
professional) and to which you belong. Then look at this list: Where are
you a listener / reader and why? Where are you active and do you
contribute yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Kata 2:</strong> In the next step, think about (possibly also
for a curation topic) which content, people and networks you would like
to have (more) contact with and create a list for this. Think about how
you can get in touch with the content, people and networks step by step
(follow topics or people, like content, connect with them in social
networks, contact them, etc.).</p>
<p>Discuss the different ways to do this in the Circle and share
recommendations. Make a plan how you can build up this contact in the
next 4 weeks.</p>
<p>A good first step as orientation for this is the [advanced Twitter
search].(https://help.twitter.com/de/using-twitter/twitter-advanced-search).
Helpful in this context are also the exercises from Working out Loud
([week
1].(https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5602f08de4b0cb7ca5d4a933/t/5cbc8d9a1905f4de3252f632/1555860891111/WOL+Circle+Guide+-+Week+1+v5.0+-+German.pdf)
and <a

href="https://media.cogneon.de/index.php/s/XY92LTGo48pzExk#pdfviewer">lernOS
Basic Guide</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>Deepening kata:</strong> If you have a little more time for
this first step, do the following networking exercise to get an idea of
how diverse your networks are and how you use them.</p>
<p>Knowing how wide or narrow your own networks are and how you use the
knowledge in those networks helps you better understand your own
learning and work. Do you primarily ask people who are similar to you,
who do the same thing professionally as you do, who you know well and
can ask directly? What impact does that have on the information you get
and the knowledge you draw from it?</p>
<p>Answer the following questions looking at the last 4 to 6 months and
enter <strong>up to 4 people</strong> for each question. The same
persons can also stand for several questions. The questions are focused
on your professional network and professional issues, but you can also
adapt these questions to reflect your personal environment and life.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Who do you talk to most when it comes to normal professional
questions and small support, e.g. for special detailed knowledge, to
proofread a text or a presentation, for brainstorming, etc.?</li>
<li>Who do you turn to when you want to solve a difficult / complex
professional problem?</li>
<li>who do you talk to when you want to advance an important project or
idea in your company? Who do you contact to get the necessary resources,
approvals and support for the project?</li>
<li>with whom do you exchange ideas if you want to open up a completely
new field of topics or tasks?</li>
<li>with whom do you exchange the most information about new
developments and trends in your profession/specialty?</li>
<li>with whom do you have the most informal contact in your job, for
talking, going to lunch and also talking about things outside the
office?</li>
</ol>
<p>How many of 24 possible names are on your list? Now look at the
structure of your network with the following questions: How many of the
people are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>older than you</p></li>
<li><p>about your age</p></li>
<li><p>younger than you</p></li>
<li><p>Your gender</p></li>

id="week-2---determine-topic-goal-and-target-group"><span
class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Week 2 - Determine topic, goal
and target group</h2>
<p>There are basically 2 entry points to get involved with content
curation:</p>
<p><strong>Entry point 1 - You want to get involved in a new topic that
is important and relevant for your professional / private
development</strong> You are searching for new information, books,
experts, processes, etc. The question arises how you can quickly and
efficiently get the right and relevant information and develop
competencies.</p>
<p>In this case, it makes sense that in a first step you obtain
recommendations on the topic from known and proven informants and
knowledge nodes from your own network (analog and digital). This is the
first quality filter that you can use yourself quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Based on the recommended content (books, seminars, blogposts,
articles, YouTube videos, etc.) you can delve deeper into “your” topic
and build up knowledge. By putting together individual knowledge
building blocks and generating and sharing something new, such as an
online article, video or podcast, you learn quickly, effectively and
purposefully. When you share your learning process with others, you
learn even faster.</p>
<p><strong>Goals of the Curator:</strong><br />
Familiarizing yourself with a new topic that is very relevant in your
professional or private life, or because there is a new problem that you
need to familiarize yourself with quickly and efficiently (possibly also
as a team).</p>
<p><strong>Entry point 2 – You are the expert for “your” topic and want
to prepare it for others.</strong><br />
You have an expertise on a topic, collect information, blogposts, videos
and podcasts and pass them on to a community in a filtered and useful
way. It is a topic in which you are very knowledgeable. Your knowledge
and reputation allow you to judge which content is right, valuable and
“worth reading”. You do your target group a favor by putting together
the right content, putting it into context and recommending it so that
they can quickly and effectively inform themselves and develop the topic
with you. This can happen internally in a company as well as for a
specific target group or colleagues from your networks.</p>
<p>Example <a
href="http://www.weiterbildungsblog.de">www.weiterbildungsblog.de</a> -
Weekly trends on continuing education topics with a brief summary and
assessment by well-known corporate learning expert Dr. Jochen Robes.</p>
<p><strong>Goals of the <em>Curator</em>:</strong> Self-learning by
filtering, assessing and further processing information on one’s special
topic, e.g. in a blog, thus showing one’s own expertise and further
developing oneself - and at the same time giving other experts or
potential customers the opportunity to contact, discuss and exchange
ideas and projects.</p>
<p><strong>Kata 3:</strong> What is your topic and with whom would you
like to share your learning?</p>
<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What kind of curation do you have in mind? Are you an expert or a
learner? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you curate primarily for yourself or for a group of people, a
network?</p></li>
<li><p>If you curate for others, who is your target audience? Can you
describe them? What makes your target group tick?</p>
<p><strong>Deepening kata:</strong></p>
<p>Do a target group analysis based on learner personas: Can you
characterize one or two people who are typical for this target group?
Tip: Use the learner personas template to describe the people
individually.   Here is a simple template as a PowerPoint file:</p>
<p><em>Persona_Vorlage_Deutsch.pptx</em></p>
<p><strong>Deeper analysis with your target group</strong><br />
If you want to go one step further, develop a detailed persona draft -
the following guide from the startup environment of Gründerszene shows
you how this works:
https://www.gruenderszene.de/operations/persona-personas-entwickeln</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kata 4:</strong> Formulate the goals of your
curation.</p></li>
<li><p>What do you want to achieve?</p></li>
<li><p>What exactly is your topic?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you active on social media? Which channels do you feel
comfortable on?</p></li>
<li><p>Where would you start sharing your curated learning
experiences?</p>
<p>Good ways to draw attention to your curation on the social Internet
are, for example, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest or Xing. Within
companies, intranet sites that are well-structured, allow social
interaction and are accessible to as many colleagues as possible are
suitable, such as <a
href="https://www.computerwoche.de/a/erfolgreich-dank-esn,3544076">enterprise
social networks</a> like HCL Connections, Microsoft Yammer, social wikis
like Confluence or SharePoint sites.</p>
<p><em>Example of a goal formulation:</em></p>
<p><em>This year I would like to deal intensively with the topic of
dealing with “data and data security”. So far, I haven’t given much
thought to what happens to my data and what the consequences might be -
but an example from the Süddeutsche Zeitung got me thinking – here’s the
link to it:
https://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/smartphone-datenschutz-tipps-android-ios-1.4716498
My goal is to understand and optimize my own digital activities, both at
work and in my private life, in terms of data security, and to make my
family and colleagues at work sensitive to the issue. I want to
formulate my experiences on an external blog (<a
href="http://www.medium.com">www.medium.com</a>) and share it on the
intranet (our enterprise social network Yammer) and on Twitter and
Linkedin.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.8"
id="week-3-4-research-and-collection-of-relevant-content-and-experts"><span
class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Week 3 + 4: Research and
collection of relevant content and experts</h2>
<p>Who do you ask when you want to get good and relevant information
quickly? What do you do intuitively? If you need help solving a problem
at work and know an expert who is happy to take time and share
knowledge, you go directly to that person. Or if you want to introduce a
new tool or process and you know people in other companies who have
already done it, you will ask them directly. And if you are planning a
major purchase in your private life, such as a car or a house, you will
inform yourself in detail over a longer period of time, talk to many
people and listen to the advice of those who are visibly good with money
and have already achieved your goals. have already achieved their
goals.</p>
<p>What they all have in common is that you know these people, you know
what they stand for and they are role models for you in this particular
area. They are trustworthy experts. You have built up a relationship of
trust with them and accept their recommendations.</p>
<p>How can this mechanism be transferred to curating?</p>
<p><strong>Kata 5:</strong> Write down 3 topics that occupy you the most
at the moment and write down 2 names behind each that you really trust.
Link the content, articles, videos and podcasts (…) and possibly also
books that you know, have read, watched or studied and listened to with
your personal comments. Make yourself a list - ideally they are people
you have already met personally - or whom you have been following
intensively for a long time and know exactly how they think and what
they stand for. They are your “trusted guides”. </p>
<p><strong><em>Excursus:</em></strong> <em>If you are looking for a tool
that allows you to quickly incorporate information from the Internet and
is easy to use, we would recommend Microsoft OneNote. OneNote is
available both for free (up to max. 5 GB) via a live.com account (<a
href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/">here</a> you can sign up if you
don’t have an account yet) or via a paid <a
href="https://www.office.com/">Office 365</a> account, which provides
much more functionality.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to try OneNote for the first time and have no idea
what to do with it, <a
href="https://colearn.de/corporate-learning-community-region-frankfurt-clc069-2-treffen-am-5-maerz-2018/">this
blogpost</a> will help you.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kata 6:</strong> Now, in the second step, find the sources
that your trusted guides particularly like to use to publish their
content. This could be their Twitter channel, their personal blog or
even a web portal or a YouTube or podcasting channel. Now search these
sources for relevant information, ideas or even references to other
people on your topic. Use, for example, the function of Google, with
which you can search a website specifically.</p>
<p><img src="./images/image8.png" /></p>
<p>Example: Google search on the site of Harold Jarche
("site:jarche.com") on Fake News</p>
<p><strong>Professional tip for Twitter users</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who wants to approach a new topic and does not yet know any
experts on it usually starts with research via a web search engine - and
this is usually Google. This is a tedious way and often does not lead to
the best results - because there are simply far too many pages listed on
Google and you won’t find any clues as to which pages are really
relevant and which are not.</p>
<p>We therefore recommend researching via Twitter, because Twitter links
people and content very quickly and effectively, and this is an immense
advantage when searching for relevant information.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the <a
href="https://twitter.com/search-advanced">advanced search</a> of
Twitter</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Deepening kata:</strong> Seek help from your followers
(#followerpower) and ask them directly via Twitter for a recommendation
on your new topic or for people who they think can help you. If you have
a good network, you will very quickly get very good and relevant
information and people recommended.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.9" id="week-5---legal-framework"><span
class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Week 5 - Legal framework</h2>
<p><strong>Important note in advance:</strong></p>
<p>We cannot give any legal advice here. Copyright is and will remain a
gray area, also because the EU requirements for Articles 13 and 17 are
currently being cast into new laws in many countries. In case of doubt
and for larger projects, you should definitely seek the advice of an
experienced media lawyer. In larger organizations, social media
guidelines also provide good advice on what is permitted and what is
not.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental:</strong></p>
<p>All media and works are subject to copyright and are protected until
70 years after the death of the author. What is protected is a work or
part of a work, a “personal intellectual creation” that is reproduced on
a medium.</p>
<p>Ideas or concepts, for example, are not protected.</p>
<p>Exceptions are the so called “Schrankenbestimmungen”:</p>
<p>Quotations (§51 UrhG) and private copies (§54 UrhG) can be made
without the permission of the author. permission of the author.</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<p>What are absolute no-go’s when curating?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using images without copyrights.</p></li>
<li><p>Not analyzing Creative Commons licenses carefully and using and
remixing content without being asked.</p></li>
<li><p>Pass off other people’s articles as your own or take them over
completely.</p></li>
<li><p>Using aggregated content from others and selling it in a product
as your own.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not name the author!</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to protect yourself legally?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the legal situation is unclear before linking / publishing,
get written permission from the copyright holder or generally ask them
directly whether you may link / use the content. They might be happy and
ideally give you more ideas or links.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use direct links whose content is stored in a portal where
you have to register - such as information portals with paywalls and
Massive Open Online Course platforms (MOOCs).</p></li>
<li><p>If you link to paid content (e.g. paid content or articles that
are behind a paywall), highlight this so that your audience knows they
have to pay for it.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re providing content for a large organization and want to
make absolutely sure that everything is legally 100% safe, find a
well-known and high-quality provider, such as Harvard Business Reviews
or LinkedIn Learning, and curate relevant content in their
portals.</p></li>
<li><p>If you not only take over, embed and forward high-quality
media/content from others, but also add value yourself by integrating it
into your own articles, podcasts or videos and thus demonstrate a high
level of creative depth, linking and curation are usually legally
unobjectionable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kata 7:</strong></p>
<p>Make up your own mind about copyright and curation. Check the credits
or the imprint of the channel of your collected Youtube videos for
copyright notices (e.g. TED Talks). Read the imprint of blogs. Make
clear which content you can mix and process in any case and which you
are only allowed to link.</p>
<p><strong>Kata 8:</strong></p>
<p>Take the collection of links, videos, and articles you created in
weeks 3 and 4. Organize your content. Which resources can you use
safely? Which are super in terms of content, but unclear in terms of
copyright? Which content can you describe and link to the maximum? Which
authors do you want to contact?</p>
<p><strong>Deepening kata:</strong></p>
<p>Research whether you can find out more information about the legal
framework for curation in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Learn how
you can best assess the risks and implement them in your curation.</p>
<p>We’d love for you to share your research results with us

<h2 data-number="2.10" id="week-6---role-of-people-in-curation"><span
class="header-section-number">2.10</span> Week 6 - Role of people in
curation</h2>
<p>The basis of content curation is your own network, the resources you
use and how you connect them. Every network and every community lives
from and with the people who contribute to it. The different roles that
people play in networks can be divided into consumers, experts,
connectors and catalysts (cf. Harold Jarche, &lt;https://jarche.com/;
&lt;https://jarche.com/2017/05/the-world-needs-knowledge-catalysts/).</p>

<p><strong>Consumers</strong> use their networks to obtain information.
They read posts to expand their knowledge without necessarily
collecting, enriching, and sharing it. collect, enrich and share it. Of
course, we are all also always consumers in our networks, especially
when we are dealing with a new topic or with topics that (at the moment)
only interest us marginally.</p>
<p><strong>Experts</strong> penetrate and understand their subject areas
in detail. But they are not necessarily good at summarizing and sharing
their knowledge. In curating, an expert is often simply someone who
knows more about a topic than you do. To develop as an expert curator,
you can practice talking, writing, summarizing, and sharing more about
your subject area in simple(er) words.</p>
<p><strong>Connectors</strong> are good networkers, know many people,
get into conversation easily with everyone and bring people together. In
curating, they help to see and build new connections and draw attention
to interesting topics, approaches, and opinions. To develop as a
connector to a curator, you can develop and practice your skills of
enriching knowledge and sharing it with added value. It is also
important to consider when, where, and with whom you share your
content.</p>
<p><strong>Catalysts</strong> are good at enriching knowledge, making
knowledge connections visible and passing on knowledge, but also at
connecting people, ideas and organizations. Catalyzing in this sense is
the fine art of knowledge management and content curation. Only a few
people are good catalysts; a basic prerequisite is that they are good
curators.</p>
<p><strong>Kata 9:</strong> In the tasks in week 1, you have already
thought about your network and certainly made contact with various
experts in one way or another. Now think together about how you can
recognize connectors in your networks (e.g. Xing/LinkedIn, Twitter) and
how this becomes visible in their contributions? In the group or alone,
think about what you can do to become better connectors. Take on two or
three points and practice them over the next four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Kata 10:</strong> Analyze your networks – who are the
experts, who are the connectors, and do you know any catalysts? What
activities characterize each of them and how would you assign these
activities to the roles. Make a table or overview and summarize your
analysis in it.</p>
<p><strong>Kata 11:</strong> What role do you play in your networks?
What role would you like to play? What do you lack to play this desired
role?  </p>
<p><strong>Deepening kata:</strong> If you have time and want to, draw a
network with the most important people on your topic. Work out what
their strengths are and whether and how they relate to each other. Think
about how you can best approach the catalysts and how you can best reach
out to them. Start curating their content, in the sense of “curating the
curators”.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.11" id="week-7---quality-and-source-check"><span
class="header-section-number">2.11</span> Week 7 - Quality and source
check</h2>
<p>From the abundance of sources and information that you have collected
on (D)a certain topic, the most important and helpful ones should now be
filtered out step by step.</p>
<p>For this purpose we recommend to ask and answer <strong>the following
questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which are the top 5 (= most important) sources in your
recommended order? (Ranking)</p></li>
<li><p>Why would you classify these sources as especially important?
(personal evaluation)</p></li>
<li><p>What important insights did you gain for your topic from the
source?</p></li>
<li><p>If applicable, are there supplementary, explanatory graphics or
learning videos that can further promote understanding and that you can
include in the explanation? (3.+4.Learning)</p></li>
<li><p>How would you sort the remaining found sources into areas or
which ones can be omitted from your point of view? (Sort out /
Selection)</p>
<p>This step-by-step classification will provide a helpful overview for
you and your audience. You can also, for example, create a template with
which you go through each source according to the questions and enter
the answers.  </p>
<p>Now it is important that your sources are truthful and of good
quality and that you question them self-critically. To do this, you can,
for example, use the criteria that journalists have developed over
decades as newsworthiness factors and, of course, also ask other topic
experts for help or exchange.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An important competence of a good curator is to recognize and uncover
<strong>false reports or fake news</strong>. Today, media companies and
influencers earn good money especially when they attract as much
attention as possible with their media (e.g., with <a
href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbaiting">clickbaiting</a>) and
serve extreme opinions. This is done primarily by advertising according
to the number of clicks placed on the mostly free articles, videos and
other media. And the artificial intelligence that automatically
recommends what we should consume next is not optimized for objectivity
and quality of the media, but to keep the user consuming as long as
possible. This is why it is of particular importance to check
information and especially sources in order to then proactively form an
opinion that is as objective and fact-based as possible. The following
diagram from the <a href="https://www.ifla.org/">International
Federation of Library Associations and Institutions</a> provides a good
working guide.:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Fake news has been around as long as there has been media. We
therefore need to know our options for debunking it, and critical
thinking is the key to recognizing it. For those who want to delve

<p><strong>Kata 12:</strong> Conduct an initial fact check for at least
two of your researched sources. A possible guideline for this is the
method guide of the <a

journalist team . Record the results in bullet points and discuss your
results together in the next meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Deepening kata 1:</strong> Arrange an appointment with one of
your experts from your network to take a closer look at the Top5 sources
with him/her, so that you can make a joint assessment at the end.

class="header-section-number">2.12</span> Week 8 - Forms of
curation</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to present the curated result
(“sensemaking”). Robin Good has collected and described a comprehensive
list of approaches and formats with many exciting examples in his
article <a
href="https://medium.com/ccontent-curation-official-guide/content-curation-approaches-types-and-formats-ae2b33fe6a18">“Content
Curation Approaches: Types and Formats”</a>. You should definitely read
this article before you start thinking about which format to use.</p>
<p>All types and formats have one thing in common - <strong><em>“finding
and organizing existing content artifacts to create new insights and
shared value”</em></strong> (<a
href="https://medium.com/content-curation-official-guide/content-curation-approaches-types-and-formats-ae2b33fe6a18%20">Robin

<p>We find the following formats or types of curation based on Robin
Good’s ideas most relevant for a learning context. We recommend that you
choose formats that you feel comfortable with (e.g. "I like to write"
- blog).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Aggregate</strong> Aggregating content describes the work
when the curator collects, describes, and provides high-quality content
or artifacts in a central location for their audience. These aggregated
contents are particularly valuable when they are provided by a
recognized expert, a so-called <strong>“Trusted Guide”</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A very good example is <a
href="https://www.immersivelearning.news/">https://www.immersivelearning.news/</a>
by Torsten Fell - a portal that provides all relevant information on
learning with augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality and
is definitely a very good starting point for a “deep dive” into the
topic.</p>

have found a reliable source, use Google Page Search to quickly get to
the information you need.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Linking</strong> Synthesizing is classically about
summarizing long, elaborate media and content into short, crisp nuggets
that nevertheless reflect the essence of the medium/content. The
selection of the media is also an achievement of the curators.</p>
<p>Classic examples are (paid) services like <a
href="http://www.getabstract.com/">www.getabstract.com</a> or <a
href="http://www.blinkist.com/">www.blinkist.com</a> that summarize
books, videos, and podcasts and present them as written text, audio, or
sketchnotes.</p>
<p><img src="./images/image15.png" /></p>
<p>Example: book summary at <a
href="http://www.blinkist.com/">www.blinkist.com</a></p>
<p>What these diverse and in-depth portals have in common is that the
individual content is usually very well and accurately summarized, but
you still have to search for the “right” content. But which content
should be interesting for you and your interests and needs, these
portals can hardly say - they act here as content aggregators, which
give a rough orientation by topic clusters and recommendations by
algorithm - real recommendations or orientation by trusted guides you do
not get.</p>
<p>One of our favorite blogs, <a
href="http://www.weiterbildungsblog.de/">www.weiterbildungsblog.de</a>,
we would also categorize as “synthesizing,” as Dr. Jochen Robes adds
value to each article he carefully filters and publishes for his HR and
Digital Learning Tribes with a brief personal assessment or summary,
giving us readers a hint as to whether we should delve deeper into the
content he curates. He also does a lot of the work for us by scouting
trends and ideas around the world, tagging them and distributing them
once a week in his newsletter.</p>

alt="CLC Munich #CLC089: Content Curation in Corporate Learning By Jochen Robes, March 202019 The Internet offers us a wealth of information. But how do we find the ones that are relevant for us or for others? The keyword is content curation, i.e. the systematic retrieval, preparation and publication of information. Stefan Diepolder talked about this in Munich. The focus was on the importance of the topic, its implications, the useful red thread of Harold Jarche (“Seek  Sense  Share&quot;) and the question of how HR developers, companies and each individual knowledge worker can benefit from it. Even though the topic is not high on any corporate learning agenda: it is almost surprising that we have not yet heard of any company and its explicit content curation strategy .… kristinauth, Corporate Learning Community, March 17, 2019 Image Source: CLC Munich" />

Meetup Content Curation</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Linking</strong> In mapping, curators collect and organize
all the important elements that describe a specific area and define the
relationship between the components.</p>
<p>The example of the <a
href="https://www.edukatico.org/de/report/coursera-groesste-globale-mooc-plattform-und-hunderttausende-lernende-aus-deutschland">MOOC
platform Coursera</a> shows that it is also possible to organize over 40
million learners and over 1000 courses from over 150 universities. In
order to provide a good user experience, the different data must be
stored in a be stored with a very good structure and linked
intelligently. Coursera succeeds in this from our point of view: you can
narrow down your search very well and still have the feeling that the
platform is small, well maintained and clear. This is evidence of very
good curatorial work.</p>

<p><strong>Distill</strong> This form of curation ensures that the most
relevant information on a specific topic is briefly described and
simplified into an order. Typical of this are “best-of” lists that
provide additional value in addition to a link. A good example of
distilling is Jane Hart’s listing of <a
href="https://www.toptools4learning.com/">300 Best Learning
Tools</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Create learning paths</strong> Learning paths are
particularly valuable when they are not provided as narrowly as in
traditional blended learning environments but rather as a kind of
guardrail for our own self-directed development.</p>
<p>We can apply what we learn in our own way in our work - or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Very interesting are e.g. annotated link lists of absolute
specialists to whom we attribute the necessary expertise, skills and
credibility, such as Christian Müller from
[www.proagile.de].(http://www.proagile.de/).</p>
<p>He manages to provide a hub on the topic of Agile with his “Agile
Toolbox”, which gives orientation to beginners and professionals in the
field of Agile alike and shows a way to deal with relevant topics and
content. The content is valuable because it is recommended by him, the
Trusted Guide and expert on Agile. We can experience Christian via
Youtube, Twitter but also in various barcamps and workshops, as he works
out loud (Working out loud) and lets us share his knowledge and
ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Explore</strong> This is journalistic work with in-depth
research and analysis, using a variety of sources and allowing for
opposing opinions and viewpoints. The goal is to give the target
audience the opportunity to form their own opinions and to foster a deep
understanding of a specific topic, story or problem by presenting
contexts in an understandable way and giving the opportunity to dive
deeper into details and differing views.</p>
<p>Vivid examples of “exploring” are in-depth blogposts with many
opportunities to link further. For example, the following post was
written by Stefan for the Corporate Learning Community blog. His
intention was to explore the topic of blockchain in depth himself. In
doing so, he enriched already collected media, such as the two embedded
videos that were relevant to him, with texts and abstracts from
blockchain specialists. It was important to him to create as
low-threshold an entry point as possible for his target audience, HR
specialists from the corporate learning community. Here is an example
for orientation:</p>

<p><strong>Kata 13:</strong> Pick out the most interesting content from
your pool of material and try to find out whether it can be assigned to
one of the formats. Find out and describe in the group why you think the
chosen format is particularly suitable (or not). (20 minutes)</p>
<p><strong>Kata 14:</strong> Find out YOUR format. Think about what your
preference is, what you enjoy, and what format will take you little
effort to create in the first step. Draw yourself a mockup, a sketchnote
or create a mindmap and imagine what your curated medium could look
like. Present your ideas to the other Circle members and discuss them
together. (40 minutes)</p>
<p><strong>Vertiefungs-Kata:</strong> Try to look at your topic from
multiple points of view, e.g. pro/con. Try to challenge your hypothesis
that you want to prove with curated content (e.g. content curation is a
waste of time). Find the right format for it and outline your idea.</p>
