Content curation helps you put together valuable information about topics with the help of content and experts, without having to reinvent the wheel. You'll learn methods, forms, and approaches for thinking outside the box about your topic and sharing your emerging knowledge with others. When you learn about content curation through this lernOS Circle Guide, you will learn about the mechanisms and differences between machine filters (via algorithms) and human filters. But you'll also learn to use curation for yourself and your life: to work more openly and visibly, and to learn to cope with the flood of available knowledge, help others, save time, and understand things. Along the way, you'll gain reputation and expertise, within your organization or in your network. You will learn that networks based on trust are the key to cope with our complex world and to learn and innovate quickly and effectively. If you want more details to help you decide if the Content Curation guide is right for you, listen to Stefan`s podcast on Content Curation -- it will definitely help you gain some insights into the topic and decide if you want to spend the next 13 weeks more intensively involved in Content Curation. The podcast (German) with Christoph Haffner and Thomas Jenewein from the SAP Education Newscast on content curation in the context of the Learntec trade fair 2020 - the episode lasts approx. 52 minutes. - (accessed on 13.10.2020) Basics If you are thinking about doing this Circle, it is best to take a look at the following basics we have put together for you. What is curation? How can one define curating? Why curate? What characterizes curators? How does curation work? What is curation? You can get a first insight via the video Stefan recorded at a meetup of the Colearn Community Munich #clc089:\\ [\"Content Curation\" by Stefan Diepolder at the meetup of the https://youtu.be/rn_AQuUxxIk (German) How can one define curating? Origin of the word \"curare\" [in Wikipedia], https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/curare#:~:text=(transitive%2C%20medicine)%20to%20treat,patient%2C%20disease%2C%20etc.), accessed on 28.07.2023) Latin \"curare\" means, among other things. ...care... ...provide... ...take the trouble... ...Feel like it... There is no universal definition of content curation, but for us this short summary, adapted from Robin Good, defines very well what it is all about: \"Content curation is the art of finding, filtering, organizing, and adding value to digital information building blocks and artifacts on a specific topic for a specific audience interest and making them publicly available.\" Robin Good: What is Content Curation? (accessed on 16.06.2020) Curation is not just the idea of a few Internet-savvy freaks. Even if they are often not called that, the skills of curators belong to the core competencies of the 21st century, as the Mozilla Foundation , for example, has worked out. Curation skills such as share, compose, remix, evaluate, synthesize, search, connect, contribute are among the 21st Century Skills promoted by the Mozilla Foundation in Web Literacy. If you go to the pages, you can go through curated learning paths on each skill. Figure: https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/web-literacy/ (CC BY 4.0) Why curate? Our problem today is no longer the lack of information, as it used to be, but the lack of reliable and efficient filters. Professor Clay Shirky expresses this very clearly. \"It`s not information overload. It`s filter failure.\" Source: Clay Shirky. AZQuotes.com, [Wind and Fly LTD], 2020. https://www.azquotes.com/quote/409865, accessed on 18.06.2020. He explains the Information Overload in 3 minutes on Youtube. The world we live in today is characterized by abundance. To cope with abundance, effective filters are necessary. No matter where we look, the first decisions are taken from us everywhere, whether we like it or not. Our Google home page, the gateway to the world's largest library, knows and remembers our preferences and search history down to the last detail -- and suggests to us, optimized and filtered by algorithms, what should interest us most in our search. If you want to go a little deeper - the video \"Beware of the Online Filter Bubbles\" by Eli Pariser describes how this mechanism works (09:05 minutes) We go to a supermarket -- and find the eye-level products that supermarket owners think we should buy -- and not the products we actually want, such as particularly low-priced or sustainable, locally produced products. And, and, and.... Let's be aware - we live in a world that is shaped by abundance and filtered and curated for us -- and where many choices and possibilities are already anticipated by technical systems or people. Music is a good example here, especially for the diversity and abundance in our world today: In the 17th century, music was still something very special. It could only be enjoyed live and only a very few rich and famous people had access to it. Then, starting in the 19th century, technical devices were invented to make music playable, from the first gramophones, record players, cassette and CD players to the invention of the mp3 format and thus the digitization of music. In the meantime, everyone can have their personal music on their smartphone with them wherever they go, often aggregated from powerful portals like YouTube, Spotify or iTunes. We find all kinds of music styles from every corner of the world and very quickly we are overwhelmed with the abundance of possibilities. To counter this, the music portals use recommendations calculated by algorithms, enable the exchange and recommendations among friends, for example, also provide their own filtered offers and playlists. And when it comes to knowledge, information and content, it's even more extreme, because knowledge grows exponentially. As the figure below shows, knowledge doubled every 13 months in 2017, with a trend toward \"much faster\". Contributing to this, for example, are simple systems and devices that are easy and quick for anyone to use by anyone and can be shared via portals and social media at lightning speed and many times over. Keeping a good overview, being able to separate the wheat from the chaff, is more important than ever. Visualization by Katrin M\u00e4ntele \\@kleinerw4hnsinn (CC BY) Source: Knowledge Doubling Curve, aus: https://www.valamis.com/blog/why-do-we-spend-all-that-time-searching-for-information-at-work , accessed on 17.06.2020 So we rely heavily on curation, and especially in the digital world, it surrounds and influences us constantly, often without us being consciously aware of it. That's why we think it's important to look at curation and its mechanisms. What characterizes curators? Curators create and design a space, arrange the artifacts they have selected and filtered, and thereby give them a new, individual value. For example, a curator of an art exhibition. A content curator learns incredibly quickly and efficiently by intensively exploring topics, immersing himself with topics, immerses himself/herself, filters and orders, curates him/herself. Especially the process of enrichment or sensemaking, in which one deals intensively with the collected content, validates it, questions it and creates something new, such as a blog post, a podcast or a video from it, initiates an efficient and intensive learning process and helps to be able to make good and well-founded decisions. Good curators know their audience and their needs and interests. They are very well connected, both with their target group (the so-called \"tribe\") and with knowledge carriers and thought leaders who are relevant to \"their\" topic. They think and work much like investigative journalists who work diligently and meticulously to find, filter, and collect the best content nuggets. They take care of their audience by providing them with their best sources and adding personal value to them, giving their audience a reason to engage with the content or topic. Visualization by Katrin M\u00e4ntele \\@kleinerw4hnsinn (CC BY) How does curation work? Content curation, as it is used in many areas today, has emerged from the overabundance of information, some of which is difficult to assess and relate. It reflects the need to find relevant information, filter it, record it, check it for facts and truthfulness, and then enrich it and create points of connection to existing knowledge. One possible approach to these steps is a three-step process according to Harold Jarche (2014) ( https://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/ ) that addresses: is concerned with searching for or finding content, information, and experts deals, the filtering and organizing and in the further, important step then enriching this content with value and opinions , and finally the possibilities of sharing and exchanging . {width=\"6.33333552055993in\" height=\"3.5520833333333335in\"}Visualization by Katrin M\u00e4ntele \\@kleinerw4hnsinn (CC BY) Competence to assess the curators (values) - values should be clear Search respectively find \\ It's about finding interesting and relevant information and staying up to date. Distinguishing the really helpful, readable and learnable posts from the \"chatter\" among all the \"noise\". And to build a network of trusted sources and experts over time. So that people not only seek out information, but it automatically finds its way to us through our network. Good curators are also always reliable members of knowledge networks.\\ Filter, organize and enrich \\ Filtering means separating the wheat from the chaff, knowing which sources and people you can trust and how to distinguish areas of knowledge from one another so as not to lose the red thread. In the next step, you have to find a clear and time-saving way to store the information, sort it and make it quickly findable.\\ Then, in the most important step, enriching the value and benefit for the target group, you can work with the content in a meaningful way and, for example, write summaries, create cross-references, compare, ask critical questions, and so on. Curating yourself and creating an article or blogpost from different building blocks and artifacts is a very effective and powerful way to learn and build knowledge yourself.\\ Share & Exchange \\ This is about developing a sense and practice for yourself, how to share your enriched content, when and with whom, how to share ideas and experiences in your networks, get feedback, get inspiration or collaborate with colleagues in your work.

I'm glad you've come together and want to use this guide to learn how to learn effectively using contacts and resources from the Internet, and how to summarize and enrich what you've learned in a way that's helpful to you and others. Take time at the beginning to introduce yourselves to each other. Ask yourself the following questions (or similar ones): Who are you? What do you do in your daily work? What are you particularly interested in? What topic have you always wanted to delve deeper into? It has proven useful to also share private things about yourself - this promotes closeness to each other, strengthens trust and quickly reveals content-related points of points of contact. Take about 20 minutes for this. What is content curation and what can you expect over the next 13 weeks? To get an initial overview, look together at the basics of curation, especially what curation is and why you should curate. The content outline (see sketchnote) gives further clues as to what you can learn and work on in this Circle. Clarify any questions together. Take about 15 minutes for this. Organization of the Circle Last but not least: How do you want to organize your Circle? We recommend that you organize Circles with a size of 4-6 people and arrange a fixed date each week when you will meet. It has also been proven that an administrator sets up the technical environment (e.g. Microsoft Teams and OneNote), sets up the Circle Guide and a structure, e.g. with learning diaries, and invites the Circle members and sets up appointments. Take about 20 minutes to do this. What basically happens in the Circle meetings? You will have 60 minutes to talk about what you have been working on during the week and how you have been doing. Before you Before you start, arrive calmly and report in the check-in (approx. 10 minutes) how you have been working on the katas during the week. Share your learnings, your difficulties and \"victories\", ask your Circle colleagues for feedback and help. Make sure that everyone has their say. In some katas you will get additional information about what you can or should do. Try to keep to the 60 minutes and it is a good idea to choose a moderator in each meeting who will lead the Circle and take care of the timekeeping. The last 5 minutes of each Circle meeting you will have time for checkout (goodbyes, goals for the next meeting, private... etc.) Preparation Kata for the complete Circle : Think about what topics you would like to learn more about, watch some videos or blogposts - or listen to podcasts - and write down what you find particularly exciting about each topic.

Now it's a matter of analyzing content once again in detail, filtering out superfluous and outdated information, arranging content and providing it with a benefit (sensemaking).

We've talked a lot about networks, the value of Trusted Guides, and social media in curating over the past few weeks. Now it's time to give back to your community. Don't wait until your blog, video, or podcast is perfect and meets all your standards. They probably never will. And there will always be people who don't like your content. And there will be those who will chafe at your content, insights and opinions. Those are likely to be the most valuable, the ones who inspire you to question, test, and evolve your executions in collaboration. Start actively sharing your content, insights and recommendations. You can do this either internally in your organization via the intranet or internal social networks (e.g. Microsoft Yammer or HCL Connections) or externally on the internet via social media, your blog or networks. Ideally, you will also succeed in sharing your ideas in talks, barcamps, meetups, podcasts and presentations. This will not only help you expand your network, but also sharpen your sensemaking skills. Some platforms we recommend out of very many where you can share your content: Intern: Microsoft 365, e.g. Onenote and Teams, to share your content with your team Enterprise Social Networks e.g. Microsoft Yammer or HCL Connections Extern: Twitter Linkedin Xing Pinterest Facebook Instagram Refind (Great also as bookmarking app) Kata 19: Recommend a YouTube video, podcast or blog post that you find particularly valuable on Twitter. Try to describe the added value in short words and keyword it with #hashtags so that it can be easily found even by interested people who don't follow you. Monitor the reaction to your post. Discuss in The lernOS Group if and how your description could be improved. Kata 20: You've been working hard on your curated content for the past two weeks. And you've already tested it in your lernOS group. Now it's time to get out there. Use your favorite social network (internal and/or external) and recommend your curated content. Ask well-connected colleagues for their opinion -- they'll be sure to recommend it if they like your post. Monitor and respond quickly and constructively to feedback. Ask for ideas and comments.... Stay tuned to your topic. Congratulations - you did it! You have actively curated and gone public with \"your\" topic.

It is about content maintenance, which is especially important for elaborately curated sources, e.g. creating permalinks so that links remain visible on your site even if the structure of your source changes. This is of course not done for aggregation and link recommendations, but for example for annotated link collections, essays etc. To keep your collected sources and content and their assessment of the topic up to date, you should look at them again and again and critically examine whether they are still relevant and helpful enough or whether there are new findings or sources in the meantime. Good curation means living and developing your content. This can be done e.g. by: Check and recheck content Create permalinks and test links Incorporate new knowledge and adapt content Create new knowledge links and make them visible Lessons Learned Now the time has come. After 12 weeks, the last round of the Circle is coming to an end and it's time to look back on these weeks. At the end, feel free to discuss what the biggest insights, surprises, or challenges were for you in dealing with content curation and share with the others.

With the Internet and social media, they have become larger, more spatially distributed and more international. The opportunities to forge relationships, access and share knowledge have thus become much richer and more diverse. On the other hand, our working world is becoming more specialized, complex and interwoven. An individual can usually no longer know everything that is necessary to solve a complex task and is dependent on a good network that gives her/him quick access to relevant information. Good networking skills have thus become one of the most important competencies for the 21st century - and also a fundamental requirement for any content curator. Networks and communities are of fundamental importance for curators: they can be sources of relevant, valuable content and experts or the starting point for researching and collecting such sources and finding experts. In a further step, a content curator always acts as a \"human filter\" who, guided by his or her own interests and knowledge background, filters relevant and interesting information and content from a large quantity. Here are a few examples of curators and well-curated sites: The Corporate Learning Community: <https://colearn.de/ - Learning network on corporate learning with contributions and activities by, for and with the community. Dr. Jochen Robes ( www.weiterbildungsblog.de ) - developments on (digital) learning and continuing education.

Kata 1: Create a collection of all networks and communities around the topics you are interested in (private or professional) and to which you belong. Then look at this list: Where are you a listener / reader and why? Where are you active and do you contribute yourself? Kata 2: In the next step, think about (possibly also for a curation topic) which content, people and networks you would like to have (more) contact with and create a list for this. Think about how you can get in touch with the content, people and networks step by step (follow topics or people, like content, connect with them in social networks, contact them, etc.). Discuss the different ways to do this in the Circle and share recommendations. Make a plan how you can build up this contact in the next 4 weeks. A good first step as orientation for this is the [advanced Twitter search].(https://help.twitter.com/de/using-twitter/twitter-advanced-search).

Do you primarily ask people who are similar to you, who do the same thing professionally as you do, who you know well and can ask directly? What impact does that have on the information you get and the knowledge you draw from it? Answer the following questions looking at the last 4 to 6 months and enter up to 4 people for each question.

The questions are focused on your professional network and professional issues, but you can also adapt these questions to reflect your personal environment and life.

In this case, it makes sense that in a first step you obtain recommendations on the topic from known and proven informants and knowledge nodes from your own network (analog and digital). This is the first quality filter that you can use yourself quickly and easily. Based on the recommended content (books, seminars, blogposts, articles, YouTube videos, etc.) you can delve deeper into \"your\" topic and build up knowledge.

What do you do intuitively? If you need help solving a problem at work and know an expert who is happy to take time and share knowledge, you go directly to that person. Or if you want to introduce a new tool or process and you know people in other companies who have already done it, you will ask them directly.

What they all have in common is that you know these people, you know what they stand for and they are role models for you in this particular area. They are trustworthy experts. You have built up a relationship of trust with them and accept their recommendations. How can this mechanism be transferred to curating? Kata 5: Write down 3 topics that occupy you the most at the moment and write down 2 names behind each that you really trust. Link the content, articles, videos and podcasts (...) and possibly also books that you know, have read, watched or studied and listened to with your personal comments. Make yourself a list - ideally they are people you have already met personally - or whom you have been following intensively for a long time and know exactly how they think and what they stand for. They are your \"trusted guides\". Excursus: If you are looking for a tool that allows you to quickly incorporate information from the Internet and is easy to use, we would recommend Microsoft OneNote.

Kata 6: Now, in the second step, find the sources that your trusted guides particularly like to use to publish their content. This could be their Twitter channel, their personal blog or even a web portal or a YouTube or podcasting channel. Now search these sources for relevant information, ideas or even references to other people on your topic. Use, for example, the function of Google, with which you can search a website specifically. Example: Google search on the site of Harold Jarche (\\\"site:jarche.com\\\") on Fake News Professional tip for Twitter users Anyone who wants to approach a new topic and does not yet know any experts on it usually starts with research via a web search engine - and this is usually Google. This is a tedious way and often does not lead to the best results - because there are simply far too many pages listed on Google and you won't find any clues as to which pages are really relevant and which are not. We therefore recommend researching via Twitter, because Twitter links people and content very quickly and effectively, and this is an immense advantage when searching for relevant information. Here is an example of the advanced search of Twitter Deepening kata: Seek help from your followers (#followerpower) and ask them directly via Twitter for a recommendation on your new topic or for people who they think can help you.

Of course, we are all also always consumers in our networks, especially when we are dealing with a new topic or with topics that (at the moment) only interest us marginally. Experts penetrate and understand their subject areas in detail. But they are not necessarily good at summarizing and sharing their knowledge. In curating, an expert is often simply someone who knows more about a topic than you do. To develop as an expert curator, you can practice talking, writing, summarizing, and sharing more about your subject area in simple(er) words. Connectors are good networkers, know many people, get into conversation easily with everyone and bring people together. In curating, they help to see and build new connections and draw attention to interesting topics, approaches, and opinions. To develop as a connector to a curator, you can develop and practice your skills of enriching knowledge and sharing it with added value. It is also important to consider when, where, and with whom you share your content. Catalysts are good at enriching knowledge, making knowledge connections visible and passing on knowledge, but also at connecting people, ideas and organizations. Catalyzing in this sense is the fine art of knowledge management and content curation. Only a few people are good catalysts; a basic prerequisite is that they are good curators.

Robin Good has collected and described a comprehensive list of approaches and formats with many exciting examples in his article \"Content Curation Approaches: Types and Formats\" . You should definitely read this article before you start thinking about which format to use. All types and formats have one thing in common - \"finding and organizing existing content artifacts to create new insights and shared value \" ( Robin Good ). Visualization by Katrin M\u00e4ntele @kleinerw4hnsinn (CC BY) We find the following formats or types of curation based on Robin Good's ideas most relevant for a learning context. We recommend that you choose formats that you feel comfortable with (e.g. \\\"I like to write\\\" -\\ blog). Aggregate Aggregating content describes the work when the curator collects, describes, and provides high-quality content or artifacts in a central location for their audience. These aggregated contents are particularly valuable when they are provided by a recognized expert, a so-called \"Trusted Guide \" . A very good example is https://www.immersivelearning.news/ by Torsten Fell - a portal that provides all relevant information on learning with augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality and is definitely a very good starting point for a \"deep dive\" into the topic. Screenshot landing page portal Immersive Learning News from Torsten Fell Pro tip : If you are looking for a specific topic and have found a reliable source, use Google Page Search to quickly get to the information you need. Linking Synthesizing is classically about summarizing long, elaborate media and content into short, crisp nuggets that nevertheless reflect the essence of the medium/content. The selection of the media is also an achievement of the curators. Classic examples are (paid) services like www.getabstract.com or www.blinkist.com that summarize books, videos, and podcasts and present them as written text, audio, or sketchnotes. Example: book summary at www.blinkist.com What these diverse and in-depth portals have in common is that the individual content is usually very well and accurately summarized, but you still have to search for the \"right\" content. But which content should be interesting for you and your interests and needs, these portals can hardly say - they act here as content aggregators, which give a rough orientation by topic clusters and recommendations by algorithm - real recommendations or orientation by trusted guides you do not get. One of our favorite blogs, www.weiterbildungsblog.de , we would also categorize as \"synthesizing,\" as Dr. Jochen Robes adds value to each article he carefully filters and publishes for his HR and Digital Learning Tribes with a brief personal assessment or summary, giving us readers a hint as to whether we should delve deeper into the content he curates. He also does a lot of the work for us by scouting trends and ideas around the world, tagging them and distributing them once a week in his newsletter. Screenshot: #clc089 Meetup Content Curation Linking In mapping, curators collect and organize all the important elements that describe a specific area and define the relationship between the components. The example of the MOOC platform Coursera shows that it is also possible to organize over 40 million learners and over 1000 courses from over 150 universities. In order to provide a good user experience, the different data must be stored in a be stored with a very good structure and linked intelligently. Coursera succeeds in this from our point of view: you can narrow down your search very well and still have the feeling that the platform is small, well maintained and clear. This is evidence of very good curatorial work. Screenshot Coursera Distill This form of curation ensures that the most relevant information on a specific topic is briefly described and simplified into an order. Typical of this are \"best-of\" lists that provide additional value in addition to a link. A good example of distilling is Jane Hart's listing of 300 Best Learning Tools . Create learning paths Learning paths are particularly valuable when they are not provided as narrowly as in traditional blended learning environments but rather as a kind of guardrail for our own self-directed development. We can apply what we learn in our own way in our work - or not. Very interesting are e.g. annotated link lists of absolute specialists to whom we attribute the necessary expertise, skills and credibility, such as Christian M\u00fcller from [www.proagile.de].(http://www.proagile.de/). He manages to provide a hub on the topic of Agile with his \"Agile Toolbox\", which gives orientation to beginners and professionals in the field of Agile alike and shows a way to deal with relevant topics and content. The content is valuable because it is recommended by him, the Trusted Guide and expert on Agile. We can experience Christian via Youtube, Twitter but also in various barcamps and workshops, as he works out loud (Working out loud) and lets us share his knowledge and ideas. Screenshot Agile Toolbox Explore This is journalistic work with in-depth research and analysis, using a variety of sources and allowing for opposing opinions and viewpoints. The goal is to give the target audience the opportunity to form their own opinions and to foster a deep understanding of a specific topic, story or problem by presenting contexts in an understandable way and giving the opportunity to dive deeper into details and differing views. Vivid examples of \"exploring\" are in-depth blogposts with many opportunities to link further. For example, the following post was written by Stefan for the Corporate Learning Community blog. His intention was to explore the topic of blockchain in depth himself. In doing so, he enriched already collected media, such as the two embedded videos that were relevant to him, with texts and abstracts from blockchain specialists. It was important to him to create as low-threshold an entry point as possible for his target audience, HR specialists from the corporate learning community. Here is an example for orientation: Link to Blogpost Another helpful example of a curated blog post by Maria Popova - Blogpost \"Fixed vs. Groth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives\" Kata 13: Pick out the most interesting content from your pool of material and try to find out whether it can be assigned to one of the formats. Find out and describe in the group why you think the chosen format is particularly suitable (or not). (20 minutes) Kata 14: Find out YOUR format. Think about what your preference is, what you enjoy, and what format will take you little effort to create in the first step. Draw yourself a mockup, a sketchnote or create a mindmap and imagine what your curated medium could look like. Present your ideas to the other Circle members and discuss them together. (40 minutes) Vertiefungs-Kata: Try to look at your topic from multiple points of view, e.g. pro/con. Try to challenge your hypothesis that you want to prove with curated content (e.g. content curation is a waste of time).

Visualization by Katrin M\u00e4ntele @kleinerw4hnsinn (CC BY) We find the following formats or types of curation based on Robin Good's ideas most relevant for a learning context. We recommend that you choose formats that you feel comfortable with (e.g. \\\"I like to write\\\" -\\ blog). Aggregate Aggregating content describes the work when the curator collects, describes, and provides high-quality content or artifacts in a central location for their audience. These aggregated contents are particularly valuable when they are provided by a recognized expert, a so-called \"Trusted Guide \" . A very good example is https://www.immersivelearning.news/ by Torsten Fell - a portal that provides all relevant information on learning with augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality and is definitely a very good starting point for a \"deep dive\" into the topic. Screenshot landing page portal Immersive Learning News from Torsten Fell Pro tip : If you are looking for a specific topic and have found a reliable source, use Google Page Search to quickly get to the information you need. Linking Synthesizing is classically about summarizing long, elaborate media and content into short, crisp nuggets that nevertheless reflect the essence of the medium/content. The selection of the media is also an achievement of the curators. Classic examples are (paid) services like www.getabstract.com or www.blinkist.com that summarize books, videos, and podcasts and present them as written text, audio, or sketchnotes. Example: book summary at www.blinkist.com What these diverse and in-depth portals have in common is that the individual content is usually very well and accurately summarized, but you still have to search for the \"right\" content. But which content should be interesting for you and your interests and needs, these portals can hardly say - they act here as content aggregators, which give a rough orientation by topic clusters and recommendations by algorithm - real recommendations or orientation by trusted guides you do not get. One of our favorite blogs, www.weiterbildungsblog.de , we would also categorize as \"synthesizing,\" as Dr. Jochen Robes adds value to each article he carefully filters and publishes for his HR and Digital Learning Tribes with a brief personal assessment or summary, giving us readers a hint as to whether we should delve deeper into the content he curates. He also does a lot of the work for us by scouting trends and ideas around the world, tagging them and distributing them once a week in his newsletter. Screenshot: #clc089 Meetup Content Curation Linking In mapping, curators collect and organize all the important elements that describe a specific area and define the relationship between the components. The example of the MOOC platform Coursera shows that it is also possible to organize over 40 million learners and over 1000 courses from over 150 universities. In order to provide a good user experience, the different data must be stored in a be stored with a very good structure and linked intelligently. Coursera succeeds in this from our point of view: you can narrow down your search very well and still have the feeling that the platform is small, well maintained and clear. This is evidence of very good curatorial work. Screenshot Coursera Distill This form of curation ensures that the most relevant information on a specific topic is briefly described and simplified into an order. Typical of this are \"best-of\" lists that provide additional value in addition to a link. A good example of distilling is Jane Hart's listing of 300 Best Learning Tools . Create learning paths Learning paths are particularly valuable when they are not provided as narrowly as in traditional blended learning environments but rather as a kind of guardrail for our own self-directed development. We can apply what we learn in our own way in our work - or not. Very interesting are e.g. annotated link lists of absolute specialists to whom we attribute the necessary expertise, skills and credibility, such as Christian M\u00fcller from [www.proagile.de].(http://www.proagile.de/). He manages to provide a hub on the topic of Agile with his \"Agile Toolbox\", which gives orientation to beginners and professionals in the field of Agile alike and shows a way to deal with relevant topics and content. The content is valuable because it is recommended by him, the Trusted Guide and expert on Agile. We can experience Christian via Youtube, Twitter but also in various barcamps and workshops, as he works out loud (Working out loud) and lets us share his knowledge and ideas. Screenshot Agile Toolbox Explore This is journalistic work with in-depth research and analysis, using a variety of sources and allowing for opposing opinions and viewpoints. The goal is to give the target audience the opportunity to form their own opinions and to foster a deep understanding of a specific topic, story or problem by presenting contexts in an understandable way and giving the opportunity to dive deeper into details and differing views. Vivid examples of \"exploring\" are in-depth blogposts with many opportunities to link further. For example, the following post was written by Stefan for the Corporate Learning Community blog. His intention was to explore the topic of blockchain in depth himself. In doing so, he enriched already collected media, such as the two embedded videos that were relevant to him, with texts and abstracts from blockchain specialists. It was important to him to create as low-threshold an entry point as possible for his target audience, HR specialists from the corporate learning community. Here is an example for orientation: Link to Blogpost Another helpful example of a curated blog post by Maria Popova - Blogpost \"Fixed vs. Groth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives\" Kata 13: Pick out the most interesting content from your pool of material and try to find out whether it can be assigned to one of the formats. Find out and describe in the group why you think the chosen format is particularly suitable (or not). (20 minutes) Kata 14: Find out YOUR format. Think about what your preference is, what you enjoy, and what format will take you little effort to create in the first step. Draw yourself a mockup, a sketchnote or create a mindmap and imagine what your curated medium could look like. Present your ideas to the other Circle members and discuss them together. (40 minutes) Vertiefungs-Kata: Try to look at your topic from multiple points of view, e.g. pro/con. Try to challenge your hypothesis that you want to prove with curated content (e.g. content curation is a waste of time). Find the right format for it and outline your idea.","title":"Week 8 - Forms of curation"},{"location":"3-0-Anhang/","text":"Sources and further links: Principles of Curation and Personal Knowledge Mastery Stefan`s Podcast on Content Curation with Christoph Haffner and Thomas Jenewein from SAP Education Newscast - https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/education-newscast/id1352307529?l=en&i=1000471555373 Blogpost about Stefan`s contribution at the Meetup of the Corporate Learning Community #clc089 in Munich - https://colearn.de/clc-muenchen-clc089-content-curation-im-corporate-learning/ Robin Good`s \"Content Curation Official Guide\" on medium.com -- THE online basic work on content curation - https://medium.com/content-curation-official-guide Robin Good`s phenomenal collection of tools on content curation - https://contentcuration.zeef.com/robin.good Harold Jarche`s detailed blog https://jarche.com on Personal Knowledge Mastery and the Seek -- Sense -- Share Framework.
